AI-Powered Smart Greenhouse Management ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–
AI-Powered Smart Greenhouse Management is an intelligent system that uses machine learning to optimize temperature, humidity, and lighting for greenhouse farming. By analyzing real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil type, crop type, and fertilizer used, the system predicts ideal conditions to enhance plant growth and maximize yield.

Key Features:
âœ… Automated Climate Control â€“ Adjusts temperature and humidity for optimal plant growth.
âœ… Smart Irrigation â€“ Optimizes water usage based on soil moisture levels.
âœ… Adaptive Lighting â€“ Regulates lighting conditions to improve photosynthesis.
âœ… Machine Learning Integration â€“ Continuously learns and improves decision-making based on data.

ðŸš€ Goal: Reduce manual effort, increase crop yield, and create a sustainable farming environment with AI! ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’¡
